# Financium

It is an online browser based Personal Finance tracker which lets the user store his (or her) monthly incomes and expenses. The application then in turn calculates the total income and expense from the individual entries and also shows the net savings the user made that month.

**The application is live at** : [Financium!](https://arnios.github.io/Financium/ "Financium")


### Features

* The application shows a percentage number beside each expense component which is the measure of how much that particular expense is of the user’s total income that month. A similar percentage is shown beside the net expense section as well.

* The user can remove individual income and expense as well if he wishes to.

  For that he will need to hover his (or her) mouse pointer over that particular income or expense and a ‘cross’ button will appear. Clicking it will delete that particular income or expense entry and swiftly will also update the net income and expenses and show the latest data while also updating all the related percentages simultaneously.

* There is also a subtle feature which has been added in order to enhance the User Experience (UX) of the application.

  Notice, the data entry text boxes lights up with green outline when the user is entering an income. While the same text boxes lights up with red outline when the user is entering an expense.
